## Introduction
The Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge was assigned as a final project for Turing School of Software Design's Front End Module 1. Students were instructed to work independently with a timeframe of one week to make a game with a minimum functionality laid out in the rubric.

The game has two options - in my case these are represented by the labels **Classic** and **Spicy**, and users can switch between the to options as they wish.

While completing this project, I feel that I built on my knowledge of and comfort with using class to class interaction. Personally, I felt that my biggest win was understanding how to separate the DOM manipulation from the data model itself.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
    - Flexbox

## Features
- When a user loads the page, they'll see a home screen with two side bars and a main page.
- Clicking on the **Change your Token!** button will allow the user to cycle through three alien token options and choose their favorite. This token will persist at the top of the user's sidebar as they play the game.
- From here, the user will be able to click on the classic or spicy game, depending on which they would prefer to play. (All buttons will change in color and size when hovered over, so that the user sees the fact that they are clickable.)
- Once, deciding on a game style, the user will be able to select their weapon of choice. The game will pause for a moment, mimicking the computer taking the time to make a selection of its own. Then, the screen will update to show the two weapons chosen by the user and computer along with text declaring the winner. The appropriate sidebar will update as well to reflect the game's new score.
- Two buttons will now appear under the chosen weapons. The user can click on **Choose again!** to play another round with the same level of difficulty, or **Switch games!** to load the other difficulty option. The side bars will keep a running score, regardless of how many times the user switches between the games.

## Possible Future Extensions
- Add local storage functionality so that user and computer wins persist upon page refresh.
- Allow users to choose between different image styles if they want a different feel to their game.
